### What I learned

Been focused on React too much lately and had to look up a couple of MDN articles to get the CSS clean =) Good to dust off and code some classic CSS again though. I need to work in a few of these challenges a week and not spend all of my time with JavaScript and libraries. Practice, practice, practice!

### Resources

- [MDN CSS intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Seriously the finest documentation available at the time of this writing for HTML, CSS, and JS.
